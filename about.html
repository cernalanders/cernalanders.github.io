        <p>So who am I? Why am I calling myself the Ders? Well, I suppose the answer there is that I am a tall, former swimmer named Anders. When Comedy Central came out with the show Workaholics all of my friends took note of the similarities between myself and the Anders character, nicknamed Ders, so I began to adopt the nickname as well. It's really nothing more than a little joke, but I always find it amusing. That bobble-head image is of the character, but I think I could pass it off as me.</p>
        <p>I was born and raised in Southeastern Connecticut, and now I live and work in Danbury. In between there I attended Wake Forest Univeristyin Winston-Salem NC, and lived in Greensboro, NC for a few years afterward. As you might be able to tell, from my logo on the top-left of your screen and my color scheme here, I am beach bum to the core. I spent my entire life going to the beach almost every day each summer (my parents live about 5 minutes from Long Island Sound). When I was in high school and college I was a lifeguard as my summer job (pay me to be on the beach for 7 hours a day, fine with me!). Now, I go back to my parents' house almost every weekend so that I can lie out on the beach for a few hours a day. I love the smell of the salt water, the feeling of the sand between my toes and the breeze coming off the water.</p>
        <p>If you were to ask me something interesting about myself I'd probably reply that I am very unusually proportioned. Most people's wing-span is supposed to be the same as their height. Well, my height is 6'3", my wingspan is 6'9". My arms are freakishly long. This comes in handy, but it can make finding shirts that fit almost impossible. Other than that, I am a major movie and trivia nerd. I have always had a knack for remembering the most random, ridiculous fact and details. This comes in very handy when I go to bar trivia, or on Thanksgiving when my family plays Trivial Pursuit.</p>
