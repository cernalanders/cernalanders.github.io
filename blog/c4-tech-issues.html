  <h3>Diversity in Tech</h3>
  <h4>Thursday August 12, 2015</h4>
    <p>We hear it almost every day. The technology field is growing very rapidly in the world, but its all white men, maybe a few Asians. Recent surveys taken on some of the world's top tech companies found that the overwhelming majority of employees were white men. While women appear to be making gains in the field, they still have a long way to go. Racial divisions appear to be even more apparent, with most employees who identify as latino making up less than 10% of employees at each company, except Apple which had 12%. One of the questions we have to ask ourselves is: why is this?</p>
    <p>The actual answer could lie in any number of places. It could be that we as a society are still moving on from very old prejudices and sterertypes. It could be access to the education required to get jobs in tech. It could be a lack of knowledge about what education is actually needed. Whatever the answer happens to be, there are several efforts across the country looking to combat this issue.</p>
    <p>In the advent of Social Media, it is becoming easier and easier to draw attention to an issue. When someone does something that stands out it doesn't take much fr it to become "viral". One instance of this was a tweet that a young woman sent to Emma Watson, the Harry Potter actress and an outspoken activist for women's rights. The girl asked Watson what she should do: She wants to be an engineer, but her father says that it's a men's profession. How can she change that? Watson's respons was short, simple, and powerful: Become an engineer. This simple sentence did a lot. It established that the girl should not have limiations put on her because of her gender, and encouraged her to be the change that she wanted to see.</p>
    <p>Twitter has also made some headlines recently with the #ILookLikeanEngineer campaign. This encourages people to take pictures of themselves to show that engineers can be men, women, hispanic, asian, black, whatever. The campaign has taken off and is meant to make people understand that anyone can be an engineer if they want.</p>
    <p>There are also non-social media projects looking to address the issue of diversity. The non-profit group Black Girls CODE is an organization that holds seminars and camps for girls of color to learn how to code. These take place on weekends and over the summer so that the girls can learn the basics of design and development. They also take the girls on field trips to tech companies so that they can get some first-hand knowledge from the workers there.</p>
    <p>Again putting the focus on young girls, the kickstarter campaign Jewelbots was successfully funded recently. Jewelbots are friendship bracelets for girls that are programable through an app. The idea is to get girls thinking and problem solving through basic code in order to generate an interest in the profession.</p>
    <p>Diversity in tech is an issue that is being addressed in many ways, but the biggest thing we can take away from these efforts is that it will take a lot of people taking action in order to reverse a troubling trend.</p>
