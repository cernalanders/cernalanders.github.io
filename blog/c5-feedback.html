  <h3>Feedback</h3>
  <h4>Thursday, August 27, 2015</h4>
    <p>Giving and receiving feedback is almost always useful. As a general principle, having a second opinion is usually a smart idea, that way you don't get too wrapped up inside your own head. Receiving feedback from my pairs has been very useful. I find that the most constructive feedback comes in real-time during a pairing session. The conversations that I have with my pair gives me the greatest sense of how I am doing culturally, because it demonstrates how I am able to develop a new, professional relationship on the spot. For technical feedback, the most useful stuff I have received has come from my guides after GPS challenges. That feedback has always been useful to me in either helping to identify some weaknesses or reassuring myself that I am on the right track. I think the next time I pair I am going to try and step back a little. I can sometimes run with my own ideas and forget that I have another person to work with, so I am 3 steps ahead of where we were and my pair is left to wonder what the heck I am doing.</p>
    <p>When it comes to giving feedback, I often find myself searching for what to say. I want to be constructive, but there have bee several cases where I didn't have any advice to give. My pair did an excellent job and I didn't know how he or she could improve. At the same time, I feel like there HAS to be something. THis might just be due to the fact that I am, on a technical level, at the same place as my pair. I don't know what can be improved because my knowledge is limited.</p>
    <p>Pairing, like feedback, is a very useful tool. It allows for two sets of eyes on the same problem. This is great. The only time I have run into trouble is when, like I said earlier, I start to go on a small tangent on my own and forget to keep my pair informed about my thought process. I think I'm getting better at that, but it still happens every once in a while. Another advantage to pairing is that it's just nice to have someone to talk to while you are working. I work so much better when there is something happening around me, and having a conversation while working is so nice.</p>
