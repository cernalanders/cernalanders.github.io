      <h3>Conflict</h3>
      <h4>Friday, September 18 2015</h4>
      <p>Conflict is unavoidable. If you go through life never having any conflicts you are probably being very timid and not taking any risks, and as one of my favorite literary quotes states: "Where is there fun without a bit of risk?"</p>
      <p>I can remember coming into conflict with the guidance counselors at the school I used to teach at. They would call me in, over the summer, in order to help with the schedules for my students (the ESL students). Myself, and the other ESL teacher at the school would come in and spend almost a full day working out the schedules: who needed to be in what classes, which classes they did NOT need to be in, and who we needed in our classes. We would then hand these over to the counselors, and then NONE of it would happen. The school year would start, and the counselors would say that they followed our recommendations as close as they could, but over half, if not all, of it would have been tossed out the window. This was done in the name of the almighty "Master" schedule. We would then have to spend the first week (sometimes longer) sorting things out. We would have students, who were in their first year trying to learn English, sitting in Spanish class, or taking advanced/honors classes. This did NOT need to happen. In the end, we'd get things back to where they needed to be (despite being told that it wouldn't work), and then we could actually start teaching.</p>
      <p>This pattern was repeated for my 3 years at the school. It made us feel that we were wasting our time (which we were not being paid for), and extremely disrespected. Unfortunately, all all attempts to stop this from happening again failed. The Bosses would listen to our complaints, guarentee that it wouldn't happen agian, and then it would. by year 3 we gave up trying and just went with it.</p>
      <p>If I could do it again, I'd refuse to do it. I wouldn't go in and waste that time. If I did, I wouldn't do as thorough a job at it. Although I'd probably get in trouble for not doing a proper job, it would be worth it. This might sound petty, but it was the point to which I was driven.</p>
      <p>Throughout the experience I learned that sometimes you can only count on yourself. You won't always win, but you have to do you and let other people do them. In the end, you just gotta go with the flow.</p>
