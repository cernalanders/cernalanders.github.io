  <h3>Affirmation and Values</h3>
  <h4>Friday, September 11, 2015</h4>
    <h5>Release 1: My Values</h5>
    <p>During my life, when I have been the happiest and most satisfied, the following values come to my mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Accomplishment</li>
        <li>Confidence</li>
        <li>Autonomy</li>
        <li>Coolness under fire</li>
        <li>Decisiveness</li>
        <li>Credibility</li>
        <li>Efficiency</li>
        <li>Friendships</li>
        <li>Insight</li>
        <li>Knowledge</li>
        <li>Persistence</li>
        <li>Truth</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Release 2: Putting my money where my mouth is</h5>
    <p>For each of these values, I try to live up to them in my general life: Disagree 1-----2-----3-----4-----5 Agree</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Accomplishment - 4</li>
        <li>Confidence - 4</li>
        <li>Autonomy - 5</li>
        <li>Coolness Under Fire - 5</li>
        <li>Decisiveness - 4</li>
        <li>Credibility - 5</li>
        <li>Efficiency - 4</li>
        <li>Friendships - 5</li>
        <li>Insight - 5</li>
        <li>Knowledge - 4</li>
        <li>Persistence - 4</li>
        <li>Truth - 5</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Release 3: Which is most imporatant?</h5>
    <p>Coolness under fire is a value that, I think, is very often overlooked. Being able to keep yourself together in a crisis is a test, one that I always try to pass. I consider myself to be a fairly even person, and if I have a lot going on in my mind you probably can't tell. I think of this as an advantage because it allows me to continue to function and get whatever it is that I'm doing done. This is a value that I think lends itself to helping make the other values on this list a reality.</p>
    <h5>Release 4: Giving advice</h5>
    <p>People tend to come to me for advice, or even just to unload on. I think this is a testament to my values of Friendship, Credibility, Insight, Truth and Coolness Under Fire. One of the last times a friend came to me for advice was on her boyfriend issues (somehow this happens alarmingly often). She was coming to me because she knew that I would keep her confidence and offer her exactly what she needed to hear (even if it wasn't what she wanted to hear). We talked for a while and she left with a better feeling about what she had to do.</p>
    <h5>Release 6: Values and Stereotype Threat</h5>
    <p>I could see holding to my values as a way to combat stereotype threat. Holding onto my autonomy and credibility will help me to know that it doesn't matter what other people think, it's about what I think of me. Forming friendships will help me to cross any barriers that may be there and help to contribute to the diverse culture at DBC. If I'm really feeling down and all of that isn't enough, then a trip to the gym or some mindless Netflix is probably the best cure.</p>
