      <h3>Functional vs Object Programming</h3>
      <h4>Friday, September 4, 2015</h4>
      <p>In the world of computer programming there are hundreds, if not thousands, of different languages to use. Each language has its own speciality and use. The thing that can tie many languages together is if they follow certain methodologies: like being an Object-Oriented Language or a Functional Programing Language. There are other options as well, but here we will only focus on these two.</p>
      <p>In an Object-Oriented Language, the world is thought of as a series of objects (duh, hence the name). These object have specific sets of behavors that they can do. For example: I have a car. That car has certain pre-set characteristics and behaviors. It has 4 wheels and an engine. It can be driven, pushed, parked, or crashed (hopefully not though). The car is the object and the behaviors are the methods that I can call on it. If I create a new car, let's call it cruze, I can call these methods to interacti with the car. Calling cruze.drive means that I am driving my cruze. My car can also interact with other objects in the world. If it interacts with a tree, for example, the result will be a crash. This means that both the objects Car and Tree need to be able to speak to one another in order to make the behavior manifest. In an Object-Oriented Language I can create new objects, even new classes of objects, and assign them specific characteristics and behaviors based on my needs. I can make a class called InterstellarShip and give it behaviors that allow it to travel faster-than-light.</p>
      <p>In contrast to this idea is the concept of Functional Programming. Here, the world is though of as a series of mathematical functions (noticing a pattern in how we name these things?). Functions are ways of creating behaviors. In this way Functional Programming is almost the opposite of Object-Oriented Programming. In Functional Programming my focus is on the behavior instead of the object. I look at the action that I want to do first, and then think about what I want to do it to. Back to the car example, I first say I want to drive. Ok, drive what? A cruze. So I program drive(cruze) and I'm off. Driving is the function, and cruze is the input. Functional languages don't change their functions, so no matter how many times I call drive(cruze) the result will be the same. This principal is best illustrated in basic algebraic functions. If f(x) = 2x + 5 and I input x = 7, then f(7) = 2(7) + 5, which equals 19. No matter how many times I do this, f(7) will ALWAYS equal 19. In this way Functional Programs are much stricter and rigid than Object-Oriented Programs.</p>
      <p>So which one is better? The answer is that it depends. Functional Programming is great for teaching problem-solving and math skills and has been used in many telecommunications programs. It also has a lot of use in financial institutions who need to compute large amounts of data based on market predictions. Object-Oriented languages can be more useful for more complex programs that require a lot of reused code. If you have an object-oriented mindset, then object-oriented programming is probably a good option for you.</p>
