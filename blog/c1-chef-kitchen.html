  <h1>Dev Bootcamp Culture</h1>
  <h2>Restaurant vs Table</h2>

     I am looking forward to joining the DBC experience (or maybe I should say experiment?)! The idea that Dev Bootcamp is a kitchen, rater than a restaurant, is very appealing to me. For anyone who is confused by what I mean here: a Kitchen mindset is where everyone is a cook in the kitchen. Some people might be a little more experienced than others, but it is going to take every one of them in order to create a final meal. In this way, Dev Bootcamp is an environment where each person is a part of a group and it will take every member in order to create the final experience. On the flip side, a Restaurant mindset is set up where you are the consumer. You paid for this experience, you are entitled to a certain experience, the end. This reminds me, somewhat, of a growth vs fixed mindset.

      I am very excited to join an environment like this. The idea that so much of the learning can come from the people around you. I have found that you can learn information out of a book, but it is you peers that are your best teachers. They will show you all of the little tricks and tips that will enhance the whole experience. I am also looking forward to joining a whole group of people who are at my level and growing alongside them. I'm definitely nervous about the whole experience, but with those nerves comes the sense of adventure. It will be so rewarding to reflect at the end of the process to see how far we have all come!

        I am also looking forward to pair programming. I love working closely with other people in order to achieve a common goal. I am also looking forward to the challenge of working with a variety of different people who all have different abilities, communication strengths and styles. Being able to effectively work with just about anyone you come across is such an important skill. This is one of the things I love about the DBC philosophy; that so much of your transformation is going to come from relationships with the people around you.

<p>Shereef's Fireside Chat also managed to aleviate some fears that I had. I was very nervous that some people were going to come in and be so far ahead that I wouldn't be able to catch up. Shereef changed my perspective a little, in that there is so much out there to learn so those people who seem far ahead are only a few steps up in the grand scheme of things. His analogy of walking from San Fransisco to New York, where some people have taken 100 steps and others have only taken 5, helped to take down myanxiety level.</p>
  <p>I'm also very interested in time boxing. This is something I feel like I used to do but have fallen out of habit. When I was in high school, I would only allow myself to work on schoolwork until a certain time at night. Whatever I didn't finish would have to wait because I was not going to drive myself crazy by staying up all night. In my Phase 0 work this week, I've tried to time box based on the average times for each challenge, and I think it is helping me to stay on track.</p>
