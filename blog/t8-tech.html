      <h3>Computer Memory</h3>
      <h4>Friday, September 18 2015</h4>
      <p>What is computer memory? It is a term that we use often enough, but many people know nothing about it other than the fact that more tends to be better (faster). The truth of the matter is that Computer Memory can refer to a number of different things: temporary storage or permanent storage, and each of those can have several different categories (RAM, ROM, cache, flash, etc.). </p>
      <p>Primary Storage, also known as temporary storage, is the main definition of what people think of as "computer memory". This type of memory is where you find your RAM (Random Access Memory), Virtual Storage, and cache. This storage works very fast, and keeps everything that the computer needs in order to operate in its memory while the computer is functioning. This means that the computer's operating system (OS) and software that run various programs that you are using are taken from the Hard Drive and placed into the RAM while they are in use. This data is deleted once the program is terminated. Thus, the more RAM your computer has, the more software it is able to store at once, making it run "faster". On top of the RAM is the cache. The cache is meant to keep bits of software that are accessed most often in a side place where they are easier to access, thus speeding up the process for the user.</p>
      <p>When it comes to permanent storage, most of the time people are referring to the computer's hard drive. Since data in RAM does not stay put when the power is cut off, we need a place to store it. The Hard Drive is where you can save things. This type of storage is where you find your ROM (Read Only Memory). The ROM cannot actually change any of its data, that is done in RAM. This memory allows the computer to keep things for the user long term. Very often, this is the part of the computer that looks like a CD/record. It is becomming more common to find solid-state hard drives, a type of storage that used to be reserved for RAM. Solid State memory is also the type of memory used in Flash Drives (an external form of Permanent Storage). Other external storage could be an external hard drive or "Cloud" storage (where the data is saved online instead of the physical computer).</p>
      <p>All of these memory types work together in order to help the computer function. They each have a specific purpose and are able to perform their tasks to provide the correct experience for the user.</p>
