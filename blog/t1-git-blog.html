  <h1>Git and GitHub</h1>
  <h2>Version Control's Role in Coding</h2>
  <h4>Wednesday July 29, 2015</h4>
<p>
     Have you every spent hours writing a paper for school? You finally finish it and in your tired stupor you you accidentally close out of the program before you saved it! All of that work gone! Well, there is a solution. It's called version control. Version control allows you to save your progress as you go so that your code (or whatever it is you are working on) is never lost. But wait, doesn't that sound a lot like just saving your material along the way? Yes it does, but version control goes a step further. Your work is saved in a central repository, usually online. This means that you can access it just about anywhere, as long as you have an internet connection! No more losing your jump drive, or leaving it in your pocket and putting it through the wash! Each time you commit your changes, you are able to revert back to that commit later on, just in case you make some changes that don't work out.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most popular tools for version control is known as git. There are others available, such as subversion, but git is one of the more widely-used ones. Git allows you to create a local repository, make additions and changes to your project, then add and commit those changes to your online repository. Whenever you plan on going and making changes, git allows you to create what is known as a "branch". A branch is simply a copy of your project that you can make changes to without mucking up your main copy. You can mess with your branch as much as you want, and if it doesn't work well you don't have to merge it with your master copy (merging is taking the changes in your branch and applying them to the main "master" copy). When you merge a branch with your master copy in your online repository, your project has been fully updated.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have mention the idea of an 'online repository' a few times thus far. What exactly is this? The answer is that an online repository is a tool for you store your materials. One of the biggest repositry hosts is GitHub (a Hub for hosting git version control, imageine that!). GitHub is an online tool for git users. It allows you to create and structure a repository and share it with as many people as you want! This means you can essentially crowd-source your coding project. With all of that input you may be able to add features that you never dreamed of! You have options to make the repository private if you don't want everyone to be able to see it. As a developer, you can also join in on other projects hosted on GitHub. This gives you the ability to be a part of any project that you are passionate about! If you are new to GitHub there is also excellent documentation provided with how to use its various services. In short, storing your code on GitHub is a safe, secure, and relatively simple way to maintain your project.
