      <h2>Revamping my Website</h2>
      <h4>Friday, Septempber 25, 2015</h4>
        <p>Working on this web site has been fun. There  were times, however, that I really did not want to work on it. For some reason it was that thing in the back of my mind that I knew I had to do, but it wasn't as important as the other stuff. Then, I actually sat down and worked on a real redo of it and, suddenly, it was a great time again!</p>
        <p>One of the first things I did was to change my background color to an image. I had tried in the past to make this work but for some reason it never did. Finally it worked (I had been using a locally saved copy of the image when I needed it to be online) and everything seemed to take off from there. It made everything seem so much nicer and more professionally done, and it was a simple change.</p>
        <p>The other thing that I am particularly glad I worked out was how to add a broder to my text. My header, and many of the titles I was using, didn't show up as well on the image background as they did on a solid color. At first I was struggling to make everything come together, trying different colors and such, but nothing would show up well. Then I discovered the shadow feature and it made everything much sharper and pop just enough to make the text look great.</p>
        <p>Other than that, the opacity feature was one that I was glad to find. It allowed the text blocks to be just translucent enough that you can see the image underneath, without disorting the text.</p>
        <p>When I put the site out there for feedback I wasn't sure what to expect. I don't have much experience with this stuff and I wasn't sure what I might hear back. I ended up getting some very useful suggestions, such as parsing some of my blog pages (hence why this one is its own piece) and having projects show up in a new window so that they don't take you away from the site itself.</p>
