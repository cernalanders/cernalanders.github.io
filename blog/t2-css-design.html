  <h2>CSS Design</h2>
  <h3>Classes vs Ids</h3>
  <h4>Wednesday August 5, 2015</h4>
<p>If you are new to programming with HTML and CSS, you have probalby wondered &quot;What the heck is the difference between a class and an id?&quot; I'm here to tell you that there isn't much of one, but you do need to be careful.</p>
<p>Classes and Ids are both used to make specific content look the way you want it. If you give a paragraph a class or an id, you can use your stylesheet to format that specific paragraph by defining colors, sizes, and positions for that class or id. In this way the two pieces are exactly the same.</p>
<p>The difference comes when you need to have a lot of items formatted the same way. If I have 5 paragraphs that I want to look different than the rest of my text, I need to give them all a class or id that I can format. Well, it turns out I can only use one. If you want to format multiple things in the same way, you must use a class. A class can be used as many times as you want throughout a page, but an id can only be used once.</p>
<p>Well now, you might be asking &quot;what is the point of an id then?&quot; The answer appears to be: JavaScript. JavaScript is a programming language that gets used a lot in web design. When using JavaScript, there are several instances where something HAS to have a unique identifier. Since ids have to be unique and can only be used once, this makes them perfect for use in JavaScript. Outside of that, most programmers steer clear of ids in favor of classes when designing HTML web pages.</p>
<p>While this &quot;abandonment&quot; of ids outside of JavaScript is becoming more and more common, it ultimately comes down to you when you are designing a page whether you will use a class or an id. The only thing you really need to ask yourself is if this is a one-time-format or not.</p>
