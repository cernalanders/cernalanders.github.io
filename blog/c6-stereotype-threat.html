  <h3>Stereotype Threat</h3>
  <h4>Friday, September 4, 2015</h4>
    <p>I'm a white male. I've always done pretty well in school, I've played several sports and done well enough, and I've had relatively steady employment since I was 16. When it comes to stereotypes, I usually feel like I got lucky. I do fit several stereotypes: I joined a fraternity in college, I lived in a devent house in the suburbs, my father was a member of a country club, we attended (and still do) a private beach, my parents bought me my own car, they paid for my undergraduate education, and I've had the opportunity to travel to Europe 5 times before I turned 27 (and am going again when I turn 28). None of these stereotypes are negative, but in discussing stereotype threat I'd like to get put them on the table.</p>
    <p>What is stereotype threat? I think we all know what a stereotype is. The thing that we usually think of as stereotyping people is normally done by us to others. We see someone and judge them based on the stereotypes that we know: he's black so he must be an athlete, she's a woman so she's not good at math, she's Asian so she's not a good driver. The list goes on and on while many of us are not aware that we are even doing it. The difference between this and stereotype threat is that with stereotype threat we are stereotyping ourselves. I am black so I should be good at sports. I am a woman so I can't be an engineer. These concepts are dangerous.</p>
    <p>Studies around this concept have been mostly focused on the academic implications. If a group of women, who are math majors, are given a math assessment and reminded that they are women before beginning, then they perform lower than their abilities predict. The same can be said of minority students. The problem is that when these people are reminded of their race, gender, or whatever it may be, they get nervous that they might confirm their stereotype and psych themselves out. This can also apply in situations where white students are competing against Asian ones. The white students are reminded that Asians are better at math, and then perform poorly. I can't say that I've ever experienced this situation, but I imagine it would be very disheartening.</p>
    <p>When I think about steretype threat, I think of it as a sympton, not a disease. The underlying issue is societal norms that have become systemic. Oppressed minorities are told that they are incapable of doing something. Some of them fight back and make gains, but the population at large seems not to change that much. This in turn leads to passing these beliefs on to our children, which starts the cycle over again.</p>
    <p>How can we combat this? While there is no clear answer, I think the biggest thing that we can do is bring it to the front of the conversation. Steretyping, and steretype threat, is a subconscious habit. How do we break habits? By focusing and consciously thinking to do so. Over time new habits begin to form and then we can begin to think less and less about them. This means that we need to have some very difficult conversations about our own prejudices and fears. This means that we need to actively pursue what is right even if it takes us into unknown territory. This means that we, as a people, need to commit to change.</p>
