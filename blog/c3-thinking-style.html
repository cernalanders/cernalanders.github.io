  <h3>Thinking Styles: A Mashup</h3>
  <h4>Wednesday August 12, 2015</h4>
    <p>When it comes to thining styles and personality types, I find myself to always in the middle. When I take Meyer's-Briggs, I always end up with each category being, at maximum, a 60-40 split. The same thing happened here. Even though the test identified me as Concrete Sequential, my Concrete Random and Abstract Sequential were tied for second with onyl 1 less response each. Looking at each of those styles, I find that I see major parts of myself in all three of those. I had the same issue when it came to the VARK assessment, I was a multi.</p>
    <p>The struggles that I've had this week I don't think have anything to do with my thinking style, because I don't think I have a specific one. I have been able to pair successfully and work independently this week. When I struggled, I was able to find some source material that explained a possible solution.</p>
    <p>I think that one way that I can grow is to contantly search out alternate sources for help. This will put me in contact with different types of source materials and potential partners that can each provide a slightly different view of a problem. In this way I can begin to work problems from multiple angles and understand multiple types of solutions.</p>
