      <h3>Asking a good question</h3>
      <h4>Friday, September 25, 2015</h4>
        <p>How do I ask a good question? That in itself is not a very good question. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of ways it could be answered and who knows which one is the answer you are looking for? The first major problem can be summed up in one word: specificity.</p>
        <p>When asking a question you need to be specific about the information you are looking for. If this were an English class then short, open-ended questions might be fine, but in fixing a code you need to be as specific as possible. Other, more specific versions of "How do I ask a good question?" might be "How much of my problem should I state in my question?" or "Should I include the expected outcome in my question?" These are much more specific and provide a lot more context to the question. Each one will elicit a different response, so you have to make sure your question is framed in a way to get the response that you need.</p>
        <p>One way to make questions (coding ones especially) good is to include sample code into your question. Instead of just describing your methods and logic, include a snippet of the problem code into the question so that you can get the specific feedback that you need.</p>
        <p>So far in phase 0, I think I fall somewhere in the middle with my questions on these requirements. For the most part, my questions have included the code that I am asking for feedback on, but I haven't been too specific. In my case, that was by design. The questions that I have been asking have been targeted at getting feedback on the code in general, not necessarily because it has problems, but because I needed advice on different ways to refactor it, or if there was a simpler way of solving the problem. These might qualify more as statements, but they still served their purpose and I received good feedback on them.</p>
        <p>Looking at the coding questions that have been brought up on the Google+ community, I think that, so far, our cohort is asking decent questions. They almost always include the code that needs review, but sometime people do not do a good job of specifiying their requests. For example, someone may just say "I get an error message, what's wrong?" instead of "I get an ArgumentError, but as far as I can see I have the correct arguments, am I misreading the error?". Other than that, I think that our questions so far are pretty good and I'm looking forward to Phase 1!</p>
